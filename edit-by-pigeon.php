	<h1>Introducing Edit-by-Pigeon!</h1>
	<p>For years, editors have been restricted to contributing to their favorite NIWA wikis via the internet, tarnished by poor connections, clunky keyboards, and weary arguments. Through a grand collaboration, several NIWA members have created a brand new service that allows anyone to submit their edits via pigeon (or pigeon-like) post.</p>

	<h1>Steps</h1>

	<p>Ready to submit an edit? Follow these steps:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Print out a copy of the article you would like to edit.</li>
		<li>Mark the copy with your edits in red ink.</li>
		<li>Request a carrier pigeon from the wiki you are editing.</li>
		<li>In 2 to 30 days, the pigeon should arrive at your home to pick up your modified article.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Our dedicated pigeons will carry your articles over to the respective wiki's staff team, who will take care to carefully transcribe your edits onto the wiki. Please note that if the article in question has been edited since your submission, your edits will be rejected and you will have to repeat the process from Step 1.</p>

	<h1>Meet the Team</h1>

	<p>Very few species were able to survive the climate catastrophe that led to the Inkopolis we know today, and the vast majority of those needed to irreversibly adapt to survive. Not so for the pigeons. These brawny little birds are not only able to survive a mass extinction event with no known ill effects, but they are also agile and quick-thinking enough to never once get inked in the midst of battle. Clearly, these traits make them the perfect contenders for the postal industry. Inklings and Octolings may think they rule the roost, but Inkopolis really belongs to the pigeons.</p>

For a small extra fee, add on some Copy Abilities for extra flair. Just make sure not to overload the poor thing, since he can barely carry Kirby as it is.</p>
